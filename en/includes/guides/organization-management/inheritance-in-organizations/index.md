# Inheritance in organizations

Parent organizations sit higher in the hierarchy and often define common behaviors for their child organizations. At the same time, child organizations need to maintain their own unique identity and configurations.

{{product_name}} allows child organizations to **inherit** and **override** configurations from their parent organizations. This model simplifies administration by letting parent organizations set baseline configurations. It also gives child organizations the flexibility to customize their settings.

The following guides explain how inheritance works for each of these features:

{% if product_name != "Asgardeo" and (product_name == "WSO2 Identity Server" and is_version != "7.0.0" and is_version != "7.1.0") %}
