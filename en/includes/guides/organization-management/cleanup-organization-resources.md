# Resources Cleanup for Deleted Organizations

When you delete an organization in WSO2 Identity Server, its associated data remains in the database. To permanently remove this data, use the cleanup scripts provided by WSO2.

## Run the cleanup

1. Clone the organization resource cleanup [repository](https://github.com/wso2-extensions/identity-organization-resource-cleanup).
2. Navigate to your product version folder. (For example, if you are using WSO2 Identity Server 7.2.0, navigate to the `7.2.0` folder.)
3. Open the `README.md` in that folder.
4. Follow the instructions in the README to run the cleanup script.
