To view the workflow approvals, you need to navigate to the **Workflow Requests** page under the **Workflow** in the Console or in the [My Account]({{base_path}}/guides/user-self-service/manage-approvals/). There, you will see a list of approvals that you can approve.

### Approval lifecycle

Approval lifecycle contains several states:

- **Reserved**: You have claimed(assigned) the approval, so no one else can approve it until you either approve or release it.
- **Ready**: You can approve this request. This status appears when no one has claimed it yet.
- **Approved**: You have approved the request.
- **Rejected**: You have rejected the request.
- **Blocked**: Another participant has claimed the approval, so you canâ€™t act on it.

!!! Note
    Claiming an approval lets you assign it to yourself. Once you claim an approval, no one else can approve it. This helps ensure that only you approve the request.

    Also note that even if you claim an approval, you can still release it back to the pool of approvals so that other participants can approve it.

### View approval details

To view the details of an approval, you can click on the approval in the list. This will open the approval details page where you can see the details of the approval related to the operation.
